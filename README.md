# Assignment #1 - Your first prototype
After you login to your build.me account, watch the intro video to get an understanding of the capabilities of the build tool. In the first
assignment you will create a new build prototype based on an existing template. This will kickstart your prototype development.

#### Create new project
From the "Start from scratch" section, choose the "Create new project" button.

Give your project a meaningful name and description. Next, choose the "Start with template" option.

#### Preview your prototype
You can now already test your prototype. Since we started with a template, it is ready for you to take a first look. Do this by clicking the "Preview" button in the top right part of the screen. Try to navigate through your prototype. To go back to the build tool, press the "Back to page map" button, also in the top right part of the screen.
