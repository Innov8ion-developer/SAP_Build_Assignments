# Assignment #2 - Edit the prototype
The wizard template that you have selected in assignment #1 is used to guide a user through a serie of steps. The wizard template is prefilled with controls. In this assignment you delete the prefilled content from the wizard template and change the titles of the wizard steps.

#### Edit the prototype

To start editing the prototype, go to the UI Editor by clicking the Wizard Page.

1. Delete controls from wizard step

   Find the wizard step "Wizard Step Product type". This is the first step on the wizard page. Delete all its children (Message Strip, Text and Horizontal Box). You can do this in two ways:
   
   + Option 1: Select the wizard step by clicking on it on the canvas until it is selected (highlighted in green). Go to the properties section and delete all the children from there.

2. Repeat for all wizard steps

   Delete the children of all wizard steps in the same way. You will end up with an empty wizard control.
