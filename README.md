2. Give your study a name and
3. Press “Create and go to feedback.”

As you can see in the “Feedback” workspace, one question is automatically created. By selecting the “preview” button you can run through the study as presented to the test subject. Let’s see what this looks like. The study preview will open in a new browser tab.

## Preview

Select “Drop comment”.
