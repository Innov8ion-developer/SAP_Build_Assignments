# Assignment #4 - Edit the prototype step 2

In this step we want to display the search result from step 1. We will display an image of the address we searched for, as well as some information about how suitable our address is for solar panels. In our prototype we would like to display that horizontally so lets navigate to the controls menu and search for: "horizontal box". You can read more about what the control does by hovering over it in the control menu.

Then you can drag the Horizontal Box into the UI editor or the Outline:

Great, now we have that in place we can delete it's first three children because we won't be needing them. We can leave one Text control though because we need one. You can select multiple controls, but you can only delete them one by one:

Next we want to add an image. To do this we can repeat the last steps but this time we will drag an Image control into our new Horizontal Box:

Great, now with our Image control in place lets go ahead and prepare an image we want to display in our prototype. Click the following link and save the image to your desktop or somewhere you can easily find it:

Now lets put the text for our search result in our Text control. Select the Text control in the UI Editor or the Outline. Then in it's Text property lets paste the following: "3 kWp (10 panelen) 3.087 kWh Energieopbrengst 3.450 Euro installatiekosten"
