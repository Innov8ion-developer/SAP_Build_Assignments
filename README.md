# Assignment #1 - Your first prototype
In the first assignment you will create a new Build prototype based on an existing template. This will kickstart your prototype development.

#### Create new project
From the "Start from scratch" section, choose the "Create new project" button.

Give your project a meaningful name and description. Next, choose the "Start with template" option.

Now select the "Wizard" template to start your prototype with an existing template.

#### Preview your prototype
You can already test your prototype. Since we started with a template, it is ready for you to take a first look. Do this by clicking the "Preview" button in the top right part of the screen. Try to navigate through your prototype. To go back to the Build tool, press the "Back to page map" button, also in the top right part of the screen.

#### The screen layout explained
Once you are back in the Build tool, click the first page of your prototype. This will bring you to the UI Editor of the Build tool. In the image below you can see four parts of the screen highlighted with an arrow. These are the parts that you will need the most to create and edit your prototype.

1. **Canvas**
...The Build tool includes a workspace, called the Design Canvas in the center of the UI Editor. Drag images and controls onto the canvas to create interactive prototypes. Use the Zoom tool on the toolbar to adjust the canvas for best viewing.

1. **Controls tab**
The UI controls that are available for a particular template are displayed in the Controls panel to the left of the canvas. The UI controls in SAP Build have predefined attributes, methods, and values that establish consistent visualization and interaction. Build includes UI controls that you can use to make prototypes interactive, without writing a single line of code.

1. **Outline**
In the UI Editor, the Outline view is an outline of your prototype contents, including controls, pages, and images. In the outline, you can:
* Rename a page: Select the page name to highlight it, and enter a new page name.
* Delete a page or control: Select the page name or control and select Backspace or Delete.
* View page contents: Select the arrow to the left of the page name to expand the view.

1. **Properties**
In the UI Editor, each control has properties defined in the right panel that you can customize for your prototype. Properties define the look and behavior of each UI control. In the UI Editor, when you select a control on your prototype page, the control properties and actions display on the Properties tab on the right-panel. Some controls can include additional properties, such as page children, size, color, and more.
