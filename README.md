# Assignment #2 - Edit the prototype step 2

In this step we want to display the search result from step 1. We will display an image of the address we searched for, as well as some information about how suitable our address is for solar panels. In our prototype we would like to display that horizontally so lets navigate to the controls menu and search for: "horizontal box". You can read more about what the control does by hovering over it in the control menu.

Then you can drag the Horizontal Box into the UI editor or the Outline:

Great, now we have that in place we can delete it's first three children because we won't be needing them. We can leave one Text control though because we need one:
