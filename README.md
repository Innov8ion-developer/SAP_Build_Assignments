# Innov8ion SAP Build Assignments
All assignments for the Innov8ion SAP Build meeting are covered in this Github repository. Every branch is one assignment. You can navigate to the next assignment by clicking the link at the end of each assignment or by choosing the corresponding branch from the branch dropdown at the top of each page.

Please read through this page for some information regarding prerequisites and general information. Then continue to the first assignment to get started.

#### General information
In these assignments we will be creating a prototype for a Fiori app. The Fiori app will be used to order solar panels for the user based on the user's address. The finished prototype will have a wizard control that guides a user through three steps in which the user will be able to enter his address details, receive an advice on number of solar panels possible and select the desired solar panels. A review page will show a summary of the entered data, after which the user can confirm his order.

#### Prerequisites
The only two things you need to complete the assignments is this github repository and a build.me account. Go to https://www.build.me and press the "Sign up" button. Enter your email address and complete the registration. You will receive an email to activate your account once you have registered. Activate your account and login to the tool.

After you login to your build.me account, watch the intro video to get an understanding of the capabilities of the build tool.
